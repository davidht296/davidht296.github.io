After discovering a passion for economics and finance I have recently graduated from the University of New South Wales, attaining a Bachelor of Economics with Distinction. Having majored in econometrics and financial economics, I have created this website as a portfolio of my economtric and data analytics work as I continue developing my skillsin the use of analytic tools such as R. 

I am highly motivated to establish myself as a professional economist, providing high quality advice on the financial and economic issues facing government agencies, businesses and citizens across Australia.

Although in the early stages of a new career path, my experience from a range of previous roles has help me discover that my professional value can be attributed to;

- a passion for establishing and building strong relationships, by always seeking firstly to understand the perspectives and experiences of others;

- proactively searching for ways to challenge myself and stretch my abilities in order to add value to my contributions;

- being authentic, and striving to never compromise my personal values or integrity;

- not caring who gets credit, instead taking enjoyment from team victories;

- being resilient, calm and resourceful when working through setbacks or stressful situations;

- beginning each task or project with a clear vision, direction and end result in mind.

I am excited to be embarking on a new chapter in my career and love making new professional acquaintances to share experiences with. Please feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin or email davidht296@gmail.com.
