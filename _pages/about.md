Although in the early stages of a new career path, my experience from a range of previous roles has help me discover that my professional value can be attributed to;

- a passion for establishing and building strong relationships, by always seeking firstly to understand the perspectives and experiences of others;

- proactively searching for ways to challenge myself and stretch my abilities in order to add value to my contributions;

- being authentic, and striving to never compromise my personal values or integrity;

- not caring who gets credit, instead taking enjoyment from team victories;

- being resilient, calm and resourceful when working through setbacks or stressful situations;

- beginning each task or project with a clear vision, direction and end result in mind.

I am excited to be embarking on a new chapter in my career and love making new professional acquaintances to share experiences with. Please feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin or email.
