  Although in the early stages of a new career path, my experience from a range of previous roles has help me discover that my professional value can be attributed to;

  - a passion for establishing and building strong relationships, by always seeking firstly to understand the perspectives and experiences of others;

  - proactively searching for ways to challenge myself and stretch my abilities in order to add value to my contributions;

  - being authentic, and striving to never compromise my personal values or integrity;

  - not caring who gets credit, instead taking enjoyment from team victories;

  - being resilient, calm and resourceful when working through setbacks or stressful situations; 

  - beginning each task or project with a clear vision, direction and end result in mind.

  I am excited to be embarking on a new chapter in my career and love making new professional acquaintances to share experiences with.
